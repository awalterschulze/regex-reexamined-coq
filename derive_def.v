   derive (a|empty)b a    = b
   derive (a|empty)b b    = empty
   derive empty b    b    = empty

(* fold_matches tries to find a expression
   `nullable (fold_left derive XS R)`
   in the goal, where XS and R are variables.
   It then applies the fold tactic to
   refold:
   `nullable (fold_left derive XS R)`
   into:
   `matches XS R`
   since that is the definition of matches.

with the cbn tactic and tries to fold back up any
matches expressions it can spot.

Theorem or_is_logical_or: forall {X: Set} {tc: comparable X} (xs: list X) (r s: regex X),
  matches (or r s) xs = (orb (matches r xs) (matches s xs)).
Proof.
  induction xs; intros; simpl_matches.
  - trivial.
  - apply IHxs.
Qed.

Theorem and_is_logical_and: forall {X: Set} {tc: comparable X} (xs: list X) (r s: regex X),
  matches (and r s) xs = (andb (matches r xs) (matches s xs)).
Proof.

(* not(not(r)) = r *)
Theorem not_is_logical_not : forall {X: Set} {tc: comparable X} (xs: list X) (r: regex X),
  matches (not r) xs = negb (matches r xs).
Proof.
  induction xs; intros; simpl_matches.
  - reflexivity.
  - apply IHxs.
