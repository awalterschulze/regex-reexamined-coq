# Standard Library we wish to have

This library is for proofs, tactics, classes, definitions, etc. that we wish existed in the Coq standard library. This wish might come from being naive, since we are still learning Coq, or it might be a legitimate wish. We aren't here to judge.

The requirement is that it is has nothing to do with regular expressions.

Examples include:
  - tactics for list
  - proofs about list_set
  - comparable class
  - a semi ring that includes orb
