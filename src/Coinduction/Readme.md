# Automata and Coinduction (An Exercise in Coalgebra) - J.J.M.M. Rutten

In this we try to play with coinduction on regular expressions to prove simplification rules.  We base the idea of the paper: [Automata and Coinduction (An Exercise in Coalgebra) - J.J.M.M. Rutten](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~janr/papers/files-of-papers/1998_CONCUR_automata_and_coinduction.pdf)
